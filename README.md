## Inspiration
Our parents and grandparents sacrificed so much for us to create the world we live in today. In today's time, our loved ones are at high risk due to COVID-19. The elderly at nursery homes are stuck being isolated in their small rooms - day after day - night after night. We wanted to create a solution that allows for a sense of community during a time like this.

## What it does
We developed a platform that allows the elderly to virtually and easily join interest group meetings over platforms like Zoom. We wanted to provide an easy-to-use solution for elderly people to scroll through the same day-to-day events they normally attended. They can subscribe to different groups and join these meetups with the click of a button.

## How I built it
We developed both a Mobile (using Flutter) and Web (using Flask, HTML) app for virtual meetups. We also developed a backend API using Flask that integrated with Zoom to create and join videos.

## Challenges I ran into
Some challenges were being apple to host the backend API on Heroku so that our mobile and web application could communicate with it. This was an important part of the project that took a LOT of time, but we are glad to have learned more about MongoDB and Heroku.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
After many many hours of struggling to be able to host the backend API, we were able to figure it out! Developing with multiple platforms was a great experience as we all learned a lot.

## What I learned
Being able to work remotely has taught us all a lot about how to efficiently communicate and update one another.

## What's next for Apartly
We hope to pinpoint apartment complexes for friends and neighbors to still enjoy the same sense of community and friendship.
